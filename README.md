# Personal Project - BookApp
## What is this project?
This is my first project I built using `React`, `Redux`, `Material UI`, `Express`, and `MongoDB`. 

The app works as a platform for users to suggest books to each other and share their thoughts about specific recommended books in the app.  

## How to start the App: 
### npm start
Start the front-end React App normally with the command: `npm start`. 
### npm run dev
Start the back-end in development mode by with the command: `npm run dev`. 

## Here is a preview of the app!
