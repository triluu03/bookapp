# Personal Project - BookApp
## What is this project?
This is my first project I built with:
- Frontend: `React`, `Redux`, `Material UI`
- Backends: 
  1. `NodeJS`, `Express`, `MongoDB`
  2. `Django`, `PostgreSQL` **(still being built)**

The app works as a platform for users to suggest books to each other and share their thoughts about specific recommended books in the app.  

## How to start the App: 
### Frontend
Start the front-end React App normally with the command: `npm start`. 
### Backend
- **Node/Express backend**: using the command `npm run dev`(in development mode)
- **Django backend**: using the command `python manage.py runserver 3001`

## Here is a preview of the app!
